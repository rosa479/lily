# Hey!
This repo includes a compiler for a simple language called Lily. \
And a presentation on compilers I made using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) .\
***
This repo was made as a part of Kharagpur Open Source Society selection task and it remains a WIP \
***
To run the compiler, you need to run /src/main.py with the path to the file you want to compile as an argument, or use the lily executable. \
At the current state of things, it can only run a return statement
\
***
The Slides can be found [here](https://rosa479.github.io/lily/) hosted on Github Pages \
The reveal.js code can be found in /docs/ \
The slides are huge, but it owes to the nature of the topic. \
